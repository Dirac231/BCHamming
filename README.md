# Qiskit Hackathon Europe 2021

 The project focuses on building a quantum version of the Hamming code and the BCH model. \
\
The official report and results are available [**here**](https://github.com/Dirac231/BCHamming/blob/main/Report.pdf)

## Abstract
Quantum error correction protocols play a crucial role in harnessing the potential of quantum computing and quantum communication systems.\
\
The "BCHamming" project aims to design and implement quantum adaptations of the Hamming and Reed-Solomon codes. We investigate the capabilities of these codes on quantum computers by simulating their performance, using noise profiles derived from actual quantum computing devices through Qiskit.

## Installation and Usage
To use this package, clone the repository and install dependencies: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Dirac231/BCHamming/
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installation, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Dirac231/BCHamming/wiki) to understand how to use/simulate the error correcting codes.
